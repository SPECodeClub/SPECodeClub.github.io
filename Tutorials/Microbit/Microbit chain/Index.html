<h1>T Hello! This tutorial will help you make a very simple BBC Micro:bit program. For this tutorial you'll need to grab a few friends, with a Micro:bit each. You'll each run a similar program, with minor diffrences. If you do it correctly, a small animation will scroll across each Micro:bit in a chain! This project uses very basic blocks, with the exception of the radio functions we will be using. For this project we will be using the 'Radio' function on the Micro:bits. Every Micro:bit is equipped with a radio transmitter and reciever, which can send strings of text and numbers. The first Micro:bit plays an animation then broadcasts '2' on its radio. It plays its animation then broadcasts '3', and so on.</h1>

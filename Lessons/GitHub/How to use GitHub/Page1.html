GitHub is a website where people in the coding community put their files. It uses a tool called git - which is actually the brains of the process, as GitHub is just a way to interact with it. If programmers make their files public, anybody in the world can see them, download them, and use them. This is useful for programmers who want to share their apps programs with the world. It can also be useful for groups of coders who all want to edit the same thing. They make their files private and only accesible to members of the group. It's not convinient for each programmer if they have to constantly send the latest version of the files to everybody - so they use Git instead. Each group of files is called a repository. People have a version of the files on their computer, and a version of their files in the repository on git. They can edit their files, commit (save the changes), then push them (update the files online to the version on yuor computer). Other people can then pull the files from online (updating the files on their computer to the latest version online). <br>The great thing about git is that rather than using the actual files, it tracks what changes you have made, and changes the files when you update them rather than overwriting them. This means that when two people are working on a file at once, both sets of changes are saved. Imagine both programmers had files X and Y. Programmer 1 changes X, and has the old Y, then saves them online. Programmer 2 changes Y, and has the old X. When he saves them, all of the changes programmer 1 made to X would be undone! <br> For our purposes, GitHub is a lot simpler than that. You can use it to access the files that the club leader put on GitHub, allowing you to see what the finished version of each tutorial would look like.

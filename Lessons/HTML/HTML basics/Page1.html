What is HTML?<br><br>
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
<br><br>
- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language<br>
- HTML describes the structure of a Web page<br>
- HTML consists of a series of elements<br>
- HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content<br>
- HTML elements are represented by tags<br>
- HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on<br>
- Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page<br>
<br>
An example HTML tag would look something like this &lt;p&gt; Hello! &lt;/p&gt;. P stands for paragraph, and produces:<br><br>
<p>Hello</p>
<br>
Another useful tag is &lt;br&gt;. This provides a new line<br>like this, or two of them creates a whole new paragraph,<br><br>like this!<br><br>This website is coded in HTML. To take a look at it, press CTRL + Shift + I. If you are using Google Chrome, you can also select the three dots in the top right corner, then select 'More tools' and 'Developer tools'.
<br><br>
HTML tags are element names surrounded by angle brackets:
<br><br>
&lt;tagname&gtcontent goes here...&lt;/tagname&gt
<br><br>
HTML tags normally come in pairs like &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt;.
The first tag in a pair is the start tag, the second tag is the end tag.
The end tag is written like the start tag, but with a forward slash inserted before the tag name.

Storage
<br><br>
Storage is a part that provides data storage. Usually this is a hard drive or SSD (solid state drive). This is often confused with RAM or memory (See section about RAM).
<br><br>
Size<br>
The physical size of the hard drive is important. 3.5 inch hard drives, are frequently used in desktop computers, however they are rarely seen in laptops due to the amount of space they take up.
<br><br>
Laptops more commonly use the smaller 2.5 inch hard drives for storage instead. These tend to have a lower capacity.
<br><br>
Capacity<br>
Aside from the physical size of the drive, each drive has a maximum capacity, the amount of data that can be stored on the drive. Drives usually have a maximum capacity that is slightly lower than what it says on the box. For example, a 4 TB drive cannot actually store 4 TB of data. This is partly due to confusion over the 1000/1024 byte problem (see the data lesson)
<br><br>
Mechanical vs Solid State<br>
For a long time, the only type of hard drives we had was mechanical drives. These drives contain moving parts and therefore they can be quite unreliable over longer periods of time, or if they are jolted while in use. They are also comparatively slower than their solid state counterparts.
<br><br>
Solid state drives contain no moving parts and therefore they are both more reliable and faster than hard drives. However, they are still significantly more expensive!
<br><br><br>
RAM
<br><br>
RAM is short for Random Access Memory. RAM can also be referred to as simply 'memory'. RAM is often confused with 'storage', which is something else entirely.
<br><br>
RAM comes in 'sticks'. Think of RAM as the number of things you can have open on your computer at once. So with 8GB of RAM, you can have 8GB of software running all at once. Part of that will be taken up with the operating system (e.g. Windows), but the rest will be for whichever programs, images etc. you have open at once.
<br><br>
If you download a video game that is 40GB in size, you don't need 40GB of RAM. A lot of that storage will be resources such as landscapes and character designs which are only loaded and unloaded as they are needed. They won't all be loaded into RAM at once.
<br><br>
A common way to speed up an old computer is to upgrade the RAM, although you should make sure that the lack of RAM is the problem first. If you already have plenty of RAM, upgrading it won't make much of a difference. A RAM upgrade is easy. You just need to take out the existing sticks of RAM and replace them with new ones. Of course, you must make sure that the RAM you buy as a replacement fits your motherboard.
<br><br>
Speed<br>
The benefit of RAM is its speed. It is much faster to read data stored in RAM than it is to read data stored on a hard drive, for example. This is why data is often taken from storage and then kept in RAM while the processor is using it. The processor will then check that data from memory, instead of from storage.
<br><br>
Volatility<br>
Since RAM is so fast, why don't we use it for storing everything? The simple answer is that RAM is volatile. This means that the data stored in RAM exists only temporarily. As soon as the computer is switched off, any data stored in RAM will vanish.
<br><br>
Compatibility<br>
There are two factors to pay attention to with RAM. The first is the type of RAM. For example, DDR4 (double data rate fourth generation) RAM is new, and some motherboards support it. DDR3 RAM was first introduced in 2007 and most motherboards will hsupport it.
<br><br>
The other thing to pay attention to is the speed, or frequency. Obviously, faster RAM is better. The speed of RAM is measured in MHz, so DDR3-2133 RAM is DDR3 RAM with a maximum speed of 2133 MHz.

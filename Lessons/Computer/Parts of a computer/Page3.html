The motherboard is the central piece to which all other components connect. Parts just slot into the board.
<br><br>
Sizes
Motherboards come in different sizes. PC cases usually come with holes pre-drilled for motherboards to attach to with screws.
<br><br>
The sizes of a motherboard are:
<br><br>
- E-ATX: The largest size, known as 'extended ATX'.<br>
- ATX: The 'standard' size.<br>
- micro-ATX: Smaller than ATX.<br>
- mini-ITX: Even smaller still.
<br><br>
Most desktop computers use an ATX or E-ATX motherboard, with micro-ATX and below usually used in laptops or other small form-factor applications. When buying a computer, you might see it called an SFF (small form factor), which mostly uses specially made parts which will only fit that computer. Gaming computers (usually customiseable) and home-built computers use one of the above classifications.<br>
<br><br>
Sockets<br>
Motherboards are often sorted based on the 'socket' type with which they are compatible. The socket is just a name given to the connector for the CPU. The processor must have a socket that is compatible with the motherboard!
<br><br>
For example, say you have a processor with a socket type of LGA 2011. If you want to connect it to a motherboard, that motherboard should also have a socket type of LGA 2011.
<br><br>
Buses<br>
Pieces of hardware naturally need to be able to talk to each other, and the motherboard is the part which does this, by using buses. Think of them as physical connections between the components that connect to the motherboard. The buses move data between parts, like buses that move people around a city.
<br><br><br>
Power Supply
<br><br>
Next we have the power supply, or PSU (Power Supply Unit). The power supply takes power from either the mains or a battery in a laptop and delivers it to the other computer parts.
<br><br>
The power supply usually connects to the motherboard, the graphics card, the hard drive and the fans. All other components, such as the processor, are usually powered by the motherboard.
<br><br>
Each power supply will be rated to provide a specific amount of power. The PSU needs to have a high enough rating to power all of the components in your computer, otherwise the computer won't switch on or may turn off randomly.
<br><br><br>
Case
<br><br>
The final part of a computer is the case. It's not too hard to figure out what it does! Cases come in different sizes, depending on the maximum motherboard size they support.

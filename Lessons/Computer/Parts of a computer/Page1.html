CPUs
<br><br>
The processor or 'Central Processing Unit (CPU)' is the 'brain' of the computer. The processor is responsible for executing the instructions contained in computer programs.
<br><br>
The front of a CPU is the piece with the silver 'lid' on it, while the back is full of gold connectors. The connectors are laid out according to the 'socket' specification. The socket type of a processor allows the processor to be used in motherboards that have a compatible socket configuration.
<br><br>
Cores<br>
Each processor contains at least one processing 'core'. The core executes instructions. Modern processors often have a few cores, enabling them to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Older processors only had a single core, meaning they could only execute a single instruction at a time.
<br><br>
Even in an older processor with only a single core, computers seem to give us the ability to perform many tasks simultaneously. For example, you might be writing a document in Microsoft Word, and have your email open in the background. While you are typing away, you might see a new email come into your inbox. How does this work if a computer can only do one thing at a time?
<br><br>
Clock Speed<br>
A computer program is broken up into a series of small instructions, which a processor can understand and execute very quickly. In fact, we often measure a processor's speed by how many instructions it can execute in one second. A processor that can execute one instruction per second has a clock speed of 1 Hz (hertz). A few modern processors can run at a clock speed of up to 4 GHz (Gigahertz). A computer with a clock speed of 4 GHz can execute 4 billion instructions per second.
<br><br>
Context Switching<br>
A single core processor does not perform multiple tasks at once. It just feels that way to the user. This is because of a process called 'context switching', where the processor shares processor time between multiple tasks, swapping back and forth between them at a speed so fast that the human mind dosn't notice it.
<br><br><br>
GPU
<br><br>
The GPU or Graphics Processing Unit is an optional part. Not every computer has one, because a GPU is just another kind of processor. It's incredible at working with numbers and doing calculations. In computers without a dedicated GPU, the CPU performs the function, but it works much more slowly.
<br><br>
Where a computer has a GPU, the processor sends the calculations necessary for displaying a picture (graphics) on the screen to the GPU, so the processor can get on with its own stuff faster. The GPU usually is found on a card called a 'graphics card'. This card contains not just the GPU, but also its own RAM where computer graphics are stored.
<br><br>
In a relatively modern graphics card, the bulk of the card is taken up by a heat sink and fan, used for sending heat away from the sensitive components.
<br><br>
Number Crunching<br>
Don't be fooled by the name 'Graphics Processing Unit', the GPU is used in all tasks that involve maths. Often GPUs are used in other number-crunching tasks, such as 3D rendering, or encryption. In cyber security, we often use graphics cards to crack passwords.
<br><br><br>
APUs
<br><br>
An APU, or Accelerated Processing Unit, is a CPU with a built in GPU. It's useful if you want a smaller or quieter PC, or onw with less parts. APUs hardly have graphics ability nearly as strong as dedicated GPUs, but it's better than nothing.

Bits<br><br>
A bit is the littlest unit of information which is stored on a PC framework. There can only be two potential states of a solitary bit: a '1' or a '0'. This is known as a 'boolean'. A 'boolean' or 'bool' for short, can just have two qualities. Consider it a switch: a switch can be one of two things: 'on' or 'off'.
<br><br>
All data in is made up of bits:
<br><br>
1 byte is 8 bits.<br>
1 kilobyte (kB) is 1000 bytes.<br>
1 megabyte (MB) is 1000 kilobytes.<br>
1 gigabyte (GB) is 1000 megabytes.<br>
1 terabyte (TB) is 1000 gigabytes.<br>
4 bits (half a byte) is called a nibble!<br>
<br><br>
Some of you may have read this and thought, that's wrong! It's 1024, not 1000!
<br><br>
Well, there's a story behind that...
<br><br>
We began by using kB to denote 1024 bytes. The problem is that the prefix 'kilo' already means something - 1000. This caused a lot of confusion, so the IEC (International Electro-technical Commission) introduced KiB instead.
<br><br>
That's a kibibyte. There are also mebibytes, gibibytes and tebibytes...
<br><br>
1 kibibyte (KiB) is 1024 bytes.<br>
1 mebibyte (MiB) is 1024 kibibytes.<br>
1 gibibyte (GiB) is 1024 mebibytes.<br>
1 tebibyte (TiB) is 1024 gibibytes.<br>
And so on...
<br><br>
However, this didn't really clear things up for most people. A lot of technical people went on thinking that 1 kB is 1024 bytes, without ever knowing that kibibytes existed.
<br><br>
It still isn't clear when someone writes kB if they mean 1000 bytes or 1024 bytes.

We normally count in 'base 10', otherwise called 'decimal' or 'denary'. The denary numbering framework begins from 0 and goes through to 9. Those are every one of the digits that are accessible. In the event that we need to tally higher than 9, we have to begin utilizing more digits. The number '12' comprises of two digits: a 1 and a 2. Composed together, it's a twelve. Why would that be? There is one 10. There are two 1s. 10 + 2 = 12. There are other number bases out there than simply base 10. Base 10 is the one we as a whole know and love.

PCs utilize base 2 which is otherwise called binary. Working with PCs, we regularly convert binary numbers to base 16 (known as hexadecimal) in because to be honest, binary numbers get long. Despite the fact that they aren't a lot shorter in base 10, base 16 makes them considerably easier to use.

This bit is extremely significant. Since we're utilizing a wide range of various number bases, we need an approach to tell which number is composed on what base. The number 10 is the ideal model. The binary number 10 in denary is 2. The hexadecimal number 10 in denary is 16.

So if we say 10, you'll most likely accept it means 10 in denary. However, imagine a scenario where we really implied 10 in binary. This issue can be solved using notation. In particular, you put the documentation before the number to determine the number base it uses. 0d is for denary. 0b is for binary. 0x is for hexadecimal. So 0d10 is 10 in denary. 0b10 is 10 in binary and 0x10 is 10 in hexadecimal.

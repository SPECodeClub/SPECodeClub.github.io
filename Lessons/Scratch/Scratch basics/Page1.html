Scratch is a programming software where you drag and drop blocks to make code. Scratch is currently in version 3. The upgrade to 3 was announced when flash announced it was ending support in 2020. As scratch 2 had previously been using flash, it needed a major move - a whole new version. With Scratch, you can program your own interactive stories, games, and animations — and share your creations with others in the online community. Scratch helps young people learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively — essential skills for life in the 21st century. Scratch is a project of the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. It is provided free of charge. Scratch is designed especially for ages 8 to 16, but is used by people of all ages. Millions of people are creating Scratch projects in a wide variety of settings, including homes, schools, museums, libraries, and community centers. The ability to code computer programs is an important part of literacy in today’s society. When people learn to code in Scratch, they learn important strategies for solving problems, designing projects, and communicating ideas.<br><br>Did you know?<br>The name 'Scratch' comes from a DJ technique called 'Scratching'. It's because Scratch, just like DJing, lets you create, remix and share!
